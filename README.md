# salt-hackday-w45

## Hackday!
Almost like the hackday you had last week, but this time you should come up with something within your mobs. Remember that you should scope it so that you think you can complete this in one day. You are allowed to use any techniques that we have used so far in this course.

Push your solutions to GitHub on a regular basis. As soon as something works - commit (with a descriptive comment) and push!

You should be working *on site at Epicenter*.
